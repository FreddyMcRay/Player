# Player
This is my student project. A simple music player.
It builds on bass.dll library (https://www.un4seen.com). Also I use metroframework (https://thielj.github.io/MetroFramework/) for my gui.
My player can play music, save tracks in playlists and display different information about tracks (information from tags).
In my opinion it has enough functions and easy to use.
